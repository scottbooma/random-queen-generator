# Random Queen Generator

This is a simple, single page web app that generates random queens from the hit show Rupaul's Drag Race and provides a little bit of information on each queen.

Data is provided by the [No Key No Shade](https://drag-race-api.readme.io/docs) API.

This is strictly an educational endeavor to help me better understand `async` / `await` functions.
