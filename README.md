# Random Queen Generator

This is a simple, single page web app that generates random queens from the hit show Rupaul's Drag Race and provides a little bit of information on each queen.

Data is provided by the [No Key No Shade](https://drag-race-api.readme.io/docs) API. It currently only contains information up through Season 11 and All Star 5, so no need to worry about any spoilers on the current season!

This is strictly an educational endeavor to help me better understand `async` / `await` functions.
